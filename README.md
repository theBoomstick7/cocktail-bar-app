<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Documentation for the "cocktail-bar-app" repository:

Introduction:
The "cocktail-bar-app" repository is a Node.js application that allows users to browse and search for cocktail recipes. The application consists of a client-side web application and a server-side API. Users can interact with the application by browsing recipes, searching for recipes, and creating new recipes. The server-side API is responsible for storing and retrieving data about the cocktail recipes.

Installation:
To install the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository using the following command:

### git clone https://github.com/theBoomstick7/cocktail-bar-app.git

Install the necessary dependencies by navigating to the server folder and running the following command:

### npm install
Start the server by running the following command in the server folder:

### node server.js

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Usage:
Once the application is running, users can interact with it by browsing and searching for cocktail recipes. The main page of the application displays a list of all available cocktail recipes. Users can click on a recipe to view more details about the recipe, including a list of ingredients and instructions for making the cocktail.

To search for a specific recipe, users can enter a search term into the search bar at the top of the page. The application will filter the list of recipes to show only those that match the search term.

Users can also create new cocktail recipes by clicking the "Add Recipe" button on the main page. This will open a form where users can enter information about the new recipe, including the recipe name, ingredients, and instructions.

API Endpoints:
The server-side API provides the following endpoints:

GET /data/cocktails - returns a list of all available cocktail recipes

GET /data/cocktails/:id - returns details about a specific cocktail recipe with the specified ID

POST /data/cocktails - creates a new cocktail recipe with the provided data

PUT /data/cocktails:id - updates the cocktail recipe with the specified ID with the provided data

DELETE /data/cocktails:id - deletes the cocktail recipe with the specified ID

Each of these endpoints can be accessed by sending an HTTP request to the appropriate URL using a tool such as curl or Postman.
